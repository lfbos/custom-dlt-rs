## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- **Git**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd custom-dlt-rs

# Build all components
cargo build --workspace --release

# Or build in debug mode (faster compilation)
cargo build --workspace
```

### Running the System

See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for a complete step-by-step tutorial on running a local blockchain network.

#### Quick Test (3 terminals)

**Terminal 1 - Start a Node:**
```bash
cargo run --bin node -- --port 9000
```

**Terminal 2 - Start a Miner:**
```bash
# Generate a key pair first
cargo run --bin key_gen miner_key

# Start mining
cargo run --bin miner -- -a 127.0.0.1:9000 -p miner_key.pub.pem
```

**Terminal 3 - Use the Wallet:**
```bash
# Generate wallet config
cargo run --bin good-wallet -- generate-config -o wallet.toml

# Edit wallet.toml to add your keys, then run:
cargo run --bin good-wallet -- -c wallet.toml -n 127.0.0.1:9000
```

## üê≥ Docker Quick Start (Recommended!)

The easiest way to run everything is with Docker:

```bash
# 1. One-time setup (builds images and generates keys)
./docker/setup.sh

# 2. Start the entire network (3 nodes + 2 miners)
./docker/start.sh

# 3. View logs
./docker/logs.sh

# 4. Check status
./docker/status.sh

# 5. Stop when done
./docker/stop.sh
```

**What you get:**
- ‚úÖ 3 interconnected blockchain nodes
- ‚úÖ 2 miners producing blocks
- ‚úÖ Persistent data storage
- ‚úÖ Isolated network
- ‚úÖ No need to install Rust!

**First run:** Takes 5-10 minutes to build (compiling in release mode)

**Ports exposed:**
- Node 1: `localhost:9000`
- Node 2: `localhost:9001`
- Node 3: `localhost:9002`

**Connect your wallet:**
```bash
# Your local wallet can connect to the Docker network
cargo run --bin good-wallet -- -c wallet.toml -n localhost:9000
```

For detailed Docker documentation, see [docker/README.md](./docker/README.md)

**Pro Tip:** Use the `Makefile` for even easier commands:
```bash
make setup    # Same as ./docker/setup.sh
make start    # Same as ./docker/start.sh
make stop     # Same as ./docker/stop.sh
make logs     # Same as ./docker/logs.sh
make help     # See all available commands
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The blockchain is fully configurable via environment variables!

### Quick Configuration

```bash
# 1. Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit as needed
nano .env

# 3. Run (automatically loads .env)
cargo run --bin node
```

### Network Profiles

Pre-configured profiles for different use cases:

```bash
# Mainnet (default - standard speed)
cp .env.example .env

# Testnet (2x faster, easier mining)
cp .env.testnet.example .env

# Devnet (5x faster, instant mining)
cp .env.devnet.example .env
```

### Environment Variable Examples

```bash
# Change block time
IDEAL_BLOCK_TIME=5 cargo run --bin node

# Easier difficulty
MIN_TARGET_HEX=0x00FFFFFFFFFFFFFF... cargo run --bin node

# Custom port
NODE_PORT=9001 cargo run --bin node

# Debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin miner
```

### What's Configurable?

- üéØ **Network parameters**: Block time, difficulty, rewards
- üåê **Node settings**: Port, peers, save intervals
- ‚õèÔ∏è **Mining config**: Batch size, update frequency
- üí∞ **Wallet config**: Update intervals, node address
- üìä **Logging**: Log level, backtraces

**See [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md) for complete reference**

1. **Start here:** [Key Concepts](#-key-concepts-explained-for-beginners) below - Fundamental blockchain concepts
2. **[DEPENDENCIES.md](./DEPENDENCIES.md)** - Understanding the libraries used (optional but helpful)
3. **[lib/README.md](./lib/README.md)** - Core concepts (UTXO, PoW, Merkle Trees) in depth

6. **[wallet/README.md](./wallet/README.md)** - User interaction
7. **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)** - Hands-on tutorial to run everything

## üîë Key Concepts Explained (For Beginners)

### Hash Functions
**What is a hash?** A hash is like a digital fingerprint - it takes any data and produces a unique fixed-size code.

```
Input: "Hello World"  ‚Üí  SHA-256  ‚Üí  Output: "a591a6d4..."
Input: "Hello World!" ‚Üí  SHA-256  ‚Üí  Output: "7f83b165..." (completely different!)
```

**Properties:**
- **Deterministic**: Same input always gives same output
- **One-way**: Can't reverse it (fingerprint ‚Üí original data)
- **Avalanche effect**: Tiny change in input = completely different output
- **Unique**: Nearly impossible to find two inputs with same output

**Used everywhere in blockchain:**
- Block IDs
- Transaction IDs  
- UTXO identifiers
- Proof-of-Work (finding hash that meets target)

---

### Public & Private Keys (Digital Wallets)
**Think of it like a mailbox:**

```
Private Key = Physical key to open your mailbox (KEEP SECRET!)
Public Key  = Your mailing address (SHARE FREELY!)
```

**How it works:**
1. You generate a **private key** (random 256-bit number)
2. Math derives your **public key** from private key (one-way!)
3. Public key becomes your "address" where people send coins
4. Only your private key can "unlock" (spend) coins sent to that address

**Security:**
- Private key is like your password √ó 1000
- If someone gets it, they steal ALL your coins
- Public key is safe to share (it's your "username")
- Can't calculate private key from public key (mathematically impossible)

---

### Digital Signatures (Proving Ownership)
**Problem:** How do you prove you own coins without revealing your private key?

**Solution:** Digital signatures!

```
1. You want to spend 10 BTC
2. Create message: "Transfer 10 BTC from UTXO #123 to Bob"
3. Sign message with your PRIVATE key ‚Üí creates signature
4. Everyone can verify signature with your PUBLIC key
5. Signature proves you own private key WITHOUT revealing it!
```

**Real-world analogy:** Like signing a check
- Only you can create your signature (private key)
- Anyone can verify it's your signature (public key)
- Can't forge your signature without your pen (private key)

---

### Nonce (Number Used Once)
The magic number that makes Proof-of-Work work!

```
Block Header:
‚îú‚îÄ Previous block hash: 0x1234...
‚îú‚îÄ Transactions merkle root: 0x5678...
‚îú‚îÄ Timestamp: 2025-10-12 14:30:00
‚îú‚îÄ Target: 0x0000FFFF...
‚îî‚îÄ Nonce: ??? ‚Üê The number we're searching for!

Mining Process:
Try nonce = 0 ‚Üí Hash: 0x9876... (too big, doesn't meet target)
Try nonce = 1 ‚Üí Hash: 0x8765... (too big, doesn't meet target)
Try nonce = 2 ‚Üí Hash: 0x7654... (too big, doesn't meet target)
...
Try nonce = 482,573 ‚Üí Hash: 0x0000A3B2... (SUCCESS! ‚úì)
```

**Why needed?**
Without the nonce, the hash would be fixed. The nonce gives us a way to keep trying different hashes until we find one that works.

---

### Coinbase Transaction (Block Reward)
**Special first transaction in every block** that creates new coins!

```
Normal Transaction:
Inputs: [Alice's 50 BTC]  ‚Üí Outputs: [Bob gets 30 BTC, Alice gets 20 BTC change]
(Must reference existing coins)

Coinbase Transaction:
Inputs: [] (EMPTY - no previous coins!)  ‚Üí Outputs: [Miner gets 50 BTC]
(Creates NEW coins from thin air!)
```

**Rules:**
1. Must be FIRST transaction in block
2. Has ZERO inputs
3. Output amount = Block reward + transaction fees
4. Only one per block
5. Name comes from "coin base" (base of new coins)

**Block Reward Schedule:**
```
Blocks 0-209:    50 BTC per block
Blocks 210-419:  25 BTC per block (halved!)
Blocks 420-629:  12.5 BTC per block (halved again!)
...
```

This is how new coins enter circulation!

---

### Satoshis vs BTC (Units)
Like dollars and cents:

```
1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC

Examples:
- 0.5 BTC = 50,000,000 satoshis
- 1,000 satoshis = 0.00001 BTC
- Transaction fee: 1,000 sats = 0.00001 BTC
```

**Why satoshis?**
- Bitcoin is divisible (like you can have $0.01)
- Allows micro-transactions
- Internally, everything is stored as satoshis (integers)
- No floating-point errors!

---

### Block Height vs Block Hash
**Two ways to identify a block:**

```
Block Height = Position in chain (0, 1, 2, 3...)
Block Hash   = Unique fingerprint (0x5d41402a...)

Example:
Block #0 (Genesis Block)
‚îú‚îÄ Height: 0
‚îú‚îÄ Hash: 0xABC123...
‚îî‚îÄ Previous Hash: 0x000000... (none, it's first)

Block #1
‚îú‚îÄ Height: 1
‚îú‚îÄ Hash: 0xDEF456...
‚îî‚îÄ Previous Hash: 0xABC123... (links to Block #0)
```

**Difference:**
- **Height**: Simple counter (easy for humans)
- **Hash**: Cryptographic proof (used by protocol)

**Why both?**
- Height for: "Get me block 100"
- Hash for: "Verify this exact block hasn't changed"

---

### Consensus (Agreement Without Trust)
**Problem:** 1000 computers need to agree on transaction order, but some might be malicious.

**Traditional solution:** Central authority (bank decides)
**Blockchain solution:** Proof-of-Work consensus

```
Scenario: Alice tries to spend same 10 BTC twice

Node A receives: Alice ‚Üí Bob (10 BTC)
Node B receives: Alice ‚Üí Charlie (10 BTC)
Nodes disagree! Who's right?

Solution:
1. Both transactions go to mempool
2. Miner includes ONLY ONE in their block
3. Miner solves Proof-of-Work first
4. All nodes accept that block
5. The other transaction gets rejected (double-spend prevented)

Consensus achieved! All nodes agree on same history.
```

**Why it works:**
- Longest chain (most work) wins
- Rewriting history requires redoing ALL the work
- 51% of mining power would need to collude
- Economically irrational (costs more than benefit)

---

### UTXO Model
Unlike account-based systems (like Ethereum), this blockchain uses **Unspent Transaction Outputs**. Each transaction consumes previous outputs and creates new ones. This provides better privacy and parallelizability.

[See detailed explanation in lib/README.md](./lib/README.md#1-utxo-model-unspent-transaction-outputs)

---

### Proof-of-Work
Miners compete to find a nonce that makes the block hash meet a difficulty target. This makes the blockchain immutable - rewriting history requires redoing all the computational work.

[See detailed explanation in lib/README.md](./lib/README.md#3-proof-of-work-pow)

---

### Difficulty Adjustment
The network automatically adjusts mining difficulty every 50 blocks to maintain a target block time of 10 seconds.

---

### Block Rewards
Miners earn rewards that halve every 210 blocks, creating a deflationary supply schedule similar to Bitcoin.
