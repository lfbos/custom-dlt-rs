## üìñ Primary Source

### "Building Bitcoin in Rust" (Book)

This project is **directly based** on the book "Building Bitcoin in Rust". The following aspects are derived from the book:

**Core Architecture:**
- UTXO-based transaction model
- Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
- Block structure and validation logic
- Merkle tree implementation
- Difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Mempool management
- Peer-to-peer networking protocol

**Implementation Approach:**
- Educational methodology
- Step-by-step building process
- Conceptual explanations
- Code organization structure

**Gratitude:**
Special thanks to the author(s) of "Building Bitcoin in Rust" for creating an accessible and comprehensive guide to blockchain development. This book provides an excellent foundation for understanding how cryptocurrencies work at a fundamental level.
